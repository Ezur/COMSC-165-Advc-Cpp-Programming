	// *COMMENT ONE*
	// This for loop is here to run through the number of quiz questions (1-20)
	// where, in each loop, the user is prompted for an answer.
	// This also encapsulates multiple conditional statements and a while loop.
	for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
	{
		cout << "Question " << i+1 << ": ";
		cin >> user_input[i];

		// *COMMENT TWO*
		// This while loop has a condition that says if the user input is not
		// A, B, C, or D, then it enters into a loop. It will ask the user
		// for their input until that while loop condition
		// is false again, and a valid input is chosen.
		while(user_input[i] != 'A' and user_input[i] != 'B' and
			  user_input[i] != 'C' and user_input[i] != 'D')
		{
			cout << "Answer only using an A, B, C, or D! Try again >> ";
			cin >> user_input[i];
		}

		// *COMMENT THREE*
		// This if statement inquires, if at that index, the user_input
		// is equal to the answer key, then increment a counter variable
		// that keeps track of the number of correct answers.
		if (user_input[i] == answer_key[i])
			correct++;
		else
		{
			// *COMMENT FOUR*
			// This else statement code runs when the value of the
			// user_input is not the same as the answer key's value.
			// The variable wrong is incremented to keep track of
			// how many times this code is run, which therefore keeps
			// track of how many wrong answers were entered.
			wrong++;

			// *COMMENT FIVE*
			// Line 69 takes the index of the value that was wrong,
			// and adds it to the array named wrong_index[].
			wrong_index[index] = i+1;

			// *COMMENT SIX*
			// The variable index is incremented by one because
			// that allows the array to keep a list of which
			// index's (the question number) was wrong.
			index++;
		}
	}

	// *COMMENT SEVEN*
	// This function output_stats() receives four parameters.
	// (1) wrong_index[] array which holds the index of the number
	// that was marked incorrect.
	// (2) correct is a counter variable that holds the value of
	// all the answers marked correct.

	// *COMMENT EIGHT*
	// (3) wrong is a counter variable that holds the value of
	// the number of wrong answers.
	// (4) index is a counter variable that is keeping track of
	// a separate counter in order to properly count the
	// number of variables inside the wrong_index array.
	output_stats(wrong_index, correct, wrong);

	return 0;
}

// *COMMENT NINE*
// output_stats function receives three parameters. It's purpose
// is to output to the console the final results of how the
// student did on their exam. The function will display if
// they passed or failed, the number of correct answers, the
// number of incorrect answers, and the question numbers
// that were incorrect.
void output_stats(int arr[], int correct, int wrong)
{
	// *COMMENT TEN*
	// the variable correct is used to decide if the student
	// passed or failed the exam. If the student received 15
	// correct answers, then they passed. If not, they failed
	// the exam.
	if (correct >= 15)
		cout << "\nThe student passed the exam." << endl;
	else
		cout << "\nThe student failed the exam." << endl;

	cout << "Correct Answers: " << correct << endl;
	cout << "Incorrect Answers: " << wrong << endl;
	cout << "\nQuestions that were answered incorrectly: " << endl;

	// *COMMENT ELEVEN*
	// This for loop is used to loop from 0 to the number of wrong
	// answers on the exam. the variable wrong is used inside of
	// the for loop to only output a specific number according to
	// earlier in the function. If we used SIZE again, then
	// the function would output 0s in place of the correct answers,
	// while still outputting the questions that were incorrect.
	// This allows the function to only output the incorrect ones.
	for (int i = 0; i < wrong; i++)
		cout << arr[i] << endl;
